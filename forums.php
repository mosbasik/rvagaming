                    <p>There are several very active communities online that focus on DotA/Dota 2.  They all have different flavors and appeal to different people.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/">Dota 2 on Reddit</a></br>One of the largest communities.  Members include pro players, community content producers, Valve developers, artists, streamers, etc.  You can find patch summaries, hero discussions, question threads and all kinds of things.  One of the easiest ways to keep an eye on the whole scene.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/vg/catalog">Dota 2 on 4chan</a></br>General game discussion going on 24/7.  Only one thread is active at a time; when it fills up at 750 posts, a new thread is created and the old one dies after a few hours.  There are enough users that it's essentially anonymous live chat, especially during professional matches.  There is no dedicated link; just find the top Dota 2 General thread in the catalog.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.playdota.com/forums/">PlayDota Forums</a></br>The original DotA website (R.I.P. DotaAllStars).  These forums are still active, though mostly concerned with DotA.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceFrog">Icefrog</a> still releases updated versions here.  There are many useful (and sometimes famous) guides stored here.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/">TeamLiquid Forums</a></br>Originally a Starcraft organization, TeamLiquid has added Dota 2 to the games they cover.  A very good website for following professional gaming, with game dates, streams, blogs by gamers, news articles, etc.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://dota2.nexon.com/">Dota 2 Nexon</a></br>The official website for Dota 2 under the Korean game company, Nexon.</li>
